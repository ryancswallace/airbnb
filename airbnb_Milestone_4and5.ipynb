    "### Milestone 4\n",
    "\n",
    "For our baseline model, we were to fit a linear regression model using the relevant features to predict price. However, the main hurdle in this task was massaging/manipulating each of the raw features so that we could fit our model while achieving interpretability and computational efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate the days of the week and holidays, we used our work on the “Average Difference from Listing’s Own Mean Price” from Milestone 3 in visualizing how prices changed throughout the year. Ultimately, we found that the real increase in per-night rental costs came on Friday, Saturday, and around the New Years’ holidays. Additionally, we found that non-holiday dates in January and February showed the lowest prices, which we deem as “slump” dates. Thus, we made categorical variables to denote the day of the week (weekend or no weekend), holiday (3 days around New Years’), and slump dates (January and February dates that aren’t around New Years’). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the categorical variables of neighborhood and zipcode have over 200 distinct values each, one-hot encoding would produce to far too many variables for a linear regression model – leading to long computational time and a small chance of over-fitting.  To solve this, we create four categorical variables for each of these features that separate the neighborhoods and zipcodes by price into quartiles. Each quartile is its own categorical variables (e.g. most expensive 25% of neighborhoods, least expensive 25% of zipcodes). Thus, we move away from trying to account for individual neighborhoods such as “Tribeca” separately and instead choose to analyze the most expensive neighborhoods together.  While we lose some degree of granularity, we believe that what is gained in computational efficiency and streamlined interpretability is well worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Milestone 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many of the data transformations were created and visualized in the Milestone 3 assignment, one of the key items that could net beneficial results is to create a clustering algorithm for zip codes and neighborhoods.  The current methodology calculates the median price for each of the zip codes and neighborhoods and sorts them by their median price.  This list of zip codes and their median prices are then grouped by quartiles.  Although this method provided a net lift in the predictive model’s accuracy, we believe that an algorithmic approach based on k-means clustering would be a better approach to determine related groups.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The current baseline model to predict daily price for the AirBnB dataset is a linear regression model which currently has an R^2 of 37%.  We believe that the predictive accuracy could be improved by exploring additional predictive models designed for a continuous dependant variable.  We will build and analyze Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression models to compare to our baseline standard linear regression model.  These models are designed to predict continuous data that has a large number of predictive variables.  We believe that one of these models will provide us with greater accuracy than the current baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our baseline and proposed methods result in a continuous number price prediction (say, $109.01 per night), we ultimately hope to generate an interval around our continuous predictions in order to provide a range of pricing options, as this seems more reasonable and useful for AirBnB hosts. We plan to do this by analyzing the prediction or confidence intervals for the results of our regressions to create ranges around our predictions in which we hope a certain fixed percentage of the true prices fall."
